# Judgr

## Preface

### What is this?

In many places, judges are elected and re-elected. But no one knows about this, and if they do it's hard to figure out who to vote for. Some areas have bar associations that review judicial candidates, but those reviews are usually in PDFs spread throughout the internet.

At some point this will be a spreadsheet. Right now it's basically a list of PDFs to copy-paste from.

### Want to help?

You don't have to be technical! All that's needed is links to Bar associations that judge judges.

If you're not technical, just click here, and put any links you find into an issue. If you're technical, feel free to fork and send a pull request.

### Watch this space.

Links to spreadsheets coming soon.
